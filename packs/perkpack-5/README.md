# Perkpack 5

Welcome to Perkpack 5! Based on Minecraft 1.21.1, the pack focuses on providing lots of different advancement trees to explore, whether you're into technology or cheesemaking. Some features from newer versions of vanilla Minecraft, such as the [Copper Age game drop](https://minecraft.wiki/w/The_Copper_Age), are included as backports. The usual slew of world gen additions, quality of life improvements, and performance optimizations is also included.

## How to play

TODO

> [!WARNING]
> **Note for Mac users:** [Distant Horizons](https://modrinth.com/mod/uCdwusMi) enables staggering view distances and wondrous vistas, but it relies on OpenGL rendering features that aren't well-supported on Macs. If your game crashes on world load, you may need to switch to Distant Horizons' slower, but more compatible, direct renderer.
>
> From the main menu, click Mod Menu > click the Distant Horizons icon in the mod list to access its config > Advanced Options > Graphics > Generic Object Rendering, and set Enabled Instanced Rendering to "False".
>
> If <em>that</em> doesn't fix the crashes, you might need to disable Distant Horizons altogether (Mod Menu > Distant Horizons icon, and set Enable Rendering to "False"). If you do this, you may also need to re-enable vanilla clouds (main menu > Options > Video Settings > Quality > Clouds), because Distant Horizons disables them in favor of its own cloud rendering.
