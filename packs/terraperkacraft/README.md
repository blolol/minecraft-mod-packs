**TerraPerkaCraft** is Blolol's [TerraFirmaCraft](https://modrinth.com/mod/terrafirmacraft) (TFC) hardcore survival Minecraft mod pack, based on Minecraft 1.20 and the NeoForge mod loader.

TerraFirmaCraft is a total conversion mod that increases the depth and raises the difficulty of Minecraft's survival mode. Expect to spend much longer in the early game, collecting sticks and stones to [knap basic tools](https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Field-Guide/en_us/getting_started/introduction.html), keeping your [campfire fueled](https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Field-Guide/en_us/getting_started/firepit.html), and contending with [hunger, thirst](https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Field-Guide/en_us/getting_started/food_and_water.html), [temperature and changing seasons](https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Field-Guide/en_us/the_world/climate.html).

Game systems are explained using an in-game field guide (press <kbd>e</kbd> to view your inventory, then click the ðŸ“˜ tab), which is also available online: https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Field-Guide/en_us/

The TerraFirmaCraft base game is further expanded with [Firmalife](https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Field-Guide/en_us/firmalife/)'s cooking and farming, and [Firma: Civilization](https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Field-Guide/en_us/firmaciv/)'s boats and navigation.

### Tips and tricks

* You can switch to borderless window mode in Main Menu > Options > Video Settings > General, and cycle Fullscreen Mode until it says "Borderless".
* To toggle [Jade](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade)'s HUD at the top of your screen that displays details of what you're looking at in the world, press <kbd>1</kbd> on your keypad with the default key binds. To customize Jade's settings, go to Main Menu > Mods > Jade > Config.
* You can filter [Just Enough Items](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei)' item list by mod name. Open your inventory screen, press <kbd>^F</kbd> (or <kbd>âŒ˜F</kbd> on a Mac) to focus the search input, and enter `@terra`, or any other fragment of a mod name prefixed with `@`, to filter the list of blocks and items to ones added by that mod. More advanced features are documented on [the mod's Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei).
