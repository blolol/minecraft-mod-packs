# TerraPerkaCraft

This is Blolol's [TerraFirmaCraft](https://modrinth.com/mod/terrafirmacraft) (TFC) hardcore survival Minecraft mod pack, based on Minecraft 1.20 and the NeoForge mod loader.

TerraFirmaCraft is a total conversion mod that increases the depth and raises the difficulty of Minecraft's survival mode. Expect to spend much longer in the early game, collecting sticks and stones to [knap basic tools](https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Field-Guide/en_us/getting_started/introduction.html), keeping your [campfire fueled](https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Field-Guide/en_us/getting_started/firepit.html), and contending with [hunger, thirst](https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Field-Guide/en_us/getting_started/food_and_water.html), [temperature and changing seasons](https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Field-Guide/en_us/the_world/climate.html).

Game systems are explained using an in-game field guide (press <kbd>e</kbd> to view your inventory, then click the ðŸ“˜ tab), which is also available online: https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Field-Guide/en_us/

The TerraFirmaCraft base game is further expanded with [Firmalife](https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Field-Guide/en_us/firmalife/)'s cooking and farming, and [Firma: Civilization](https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Field-Guide/en_us/firmaciv/)'s boats and navigation.

## How to play

If you haven't played Minecraft in a while, you might want to peruse the last few major game updates to see what's new:

* [1.20 "Trails & Tails" update guide](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_guides/Trails_%26_Tales) (June 2023)
* [1.19 "The Wild" update guide](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_guides/The_Wild_Update) (June 2022)
* [1.17 and 1.18 "Caves & Cliffs" update guide](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_guides/Caves_%26_Cliffs:_Part_I) (June 2021)

It's just a few clicks to install Java, the game launcher, and the mod pack. Once you've installed it, TerraPerkaCraft will keep itself up to date each time you launch it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> TerraPerkaCraft and Minecraft 1.20.1 **require Java 17,** and are incompatible with newer or older releases. Make sure you install the correct version!

2. Install [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org).
3. In Prism Launcher, click "Add Instance", then "Import".
4. Give the instance a name like "TerraPerkaCraft", then paste in this URL: https://github.com/blolol/minecraft-mod-packs/raw/main/packs/terraperkacraft/prism-instance.zip
5. Right-click the instance, select Edit > Settings > Java, and ensure the selected version of Java points to an installation of Java 17.
