# Perkpack: Big Globe

Perkpack: Big Globe is a Blolol Minecraft mod pack based on the [Big Globe](https://modrinth.com/project/xsng1aJf) terrain generator by [Builderb0y](https://modrinth.com/user/Builderb0y). It's designed to be a relatively lightweight, casual survival-oriented pack with a dash of quality of life features (and, importantly, kiwis), but leaves Big Globe's vast world in the spotlight.

## How to play

To install the pack, import [prism-instance.zip](./prism-instance.zip) into [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/).

## Mods

Perkpack: Big Globe uses [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/project/1KVo5zza) as a base. The only mod excluded is [Controlify](https://modrinth.com/project/DOUdJVEm), to avoid confusing setup prompts for keyboards and mice that are incorrectly identified as game controllers. If you wish to use it (or any other client-side mod), Controlify can be easily added on top of this Perkpack: Big Globe using your game launcher of choice.
