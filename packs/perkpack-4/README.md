# Perkpack 4

This is the in-development configuration for Perkpack 4, based on Minecraft 1.20.4 and the Fabric mod loader. It's built on top of [Fabulously Optimized](https://download.fo/) as a performant base.

Like Perkpack 3, Perkpack 4 is managed using [packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz), so you can refer to `../perkpack/README.md` for further documentation.
