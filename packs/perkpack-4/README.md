# Perkpack 4

This is the in-development Perkpack 4 mod pack preview, based on Minecraft 1.21 and the Fabric mod loader.

If you're coming from Perkpack 3 and haven't kept up with Minecraft news, you might want to peruse the big changes in the last few major game updates:

* [1.20 "Trails & Tails" update guide](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_guides/Trails_%26_Tales)
* [1.20.5 "Armored Paws" update guide](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_guides/Armored_Paws)
* [1.21 "Tricky Trials" update guide](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_guides/Tricky_Trials)

## Versions

Perkpack bumps its major version number for each significant Minecraft update (e.g. from Minecraft 1.20 to 1.21).

| Perkpack Version     | Minecraft Version | Java Version |
|----------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| [Perkpack 4](https://github.com/blolol/minecraft-mod-packs/tree/main/packs/perkpack-4#readme) (preview) | [Minecraft 1.21](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_1.21) | Java 21 |
| [Perkpack 3](https://github.com/blolol/minecraft-mod-packs/tree/main/packs/perkpack#readme) (current) | [Minecraft 1.20](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_1.20) | Java 17 |
| Perkpack 2           | [Minecraft 1.18](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_1.18)    | Java 17      |
| Perkpack 1           | [Minecraft 1.17](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_1.17)    | Java 17      |

As described in ["How to play"](#how-to-play), below, the mod pack automatically keeps itself up to date once you've installed it. If you're interested in the changes between versions, you can find release notes here: https://github.com/blolol/minecraft-mod-packs/releases

Mod pack updates are also announced by Wheaties in the `#minecraft` channels of [Blolol's IRC and Discord servers](https://blolol.com/chat).

## How to play

Playing the Perkpack 4 preview is, like Perkpack 3, pretty simple stuff. You'll only need to install the mod pack once. It will otherwise automatically keep itself up to date.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **If you haven't yet played Minecraft 1.21, you'll probably need to install Java 21** in step one below. Perkpack 3 is based on Minecraft 1.20.1, which uses Java 17. In Minecraft [1.20.5](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_1.20.5), Mojang updated the game to require Java 21. Perkpack 4 is based on the latest major release as of summer 2024, Minecraft 1.21.
>
> Multiple versions of Java can coexist without a problem, but you'll need to either override the Perkpack 4 Prism instance's Java version (right-click > Edit > Settings > Java), or change your default Java version in Prism Launcher's global settings.

1. Install [Java 21](https://prismlauncher.org/wiki/getting-started/installing-java/).
1. Install [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org).
1. In Prism Launcher, click "Add Instance", then "Import".
1. Give the instance a name like "Perkpack 4 Preview", then paste in this URL: https://github.com/blolol/minecraft-mod-packs/raw/main/packs/perkpack-4/prism-instance.zip
1. Right-click the instance, select Edit > Settings > Java, and ensure the Java installation points to an installation of Java 21.
1. Once you're in-game, connect to `pp4.mc.blolol.dev`.

### Helpful tips

* **Borderless windowed mode:** In video settings, you can toggle "fullscreen" to "borderless", thanks to [Cubes Without Borders](https://modrinth.com/mod/cubes-without-borders).
* **Shaders:** Press <kbd>o</kbd> to choose a shader pack, and <kbd>k</kbd> to toggle them on and off.
* **Zooming:** Press <kbd>c</kbd> and use your mouse wheel to zoom using the [Ok Zoomer](https://modrinth.com/mod/ok-zoomer) mod.
* **Maps:** You can mix and match a minimap on your HUD and a full-screen world map. Both are highly configurable.
  * Press <kbd>m</kbd> to open [Xaero's World Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map).
  * Press <kbd>n</kbd> to toggle [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap).
* **[Jade](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade)** can show you details about the block or entity you're looking at. Press <kbd>1</kbd> on your numpad to toggle it.
* **[Horse Buff](https://modrinth.com/mod/horsebuff)** prevents saddled horses from wandering, so you don't need to carry a lead and a fence post. Horses also no longer sink in water, so you can swim across rivers without dismounting. There are a couple of other useful features as well; check the mod's page for details.
* **[Auto run](https://modrinth.com/mod/autorun)** not only works for running with your own two legs, but also with boats, horses, and other mounts. Press <kbd>`</kbd> (backtick) to toggle it.
* Want to **chop down entire trees at once, or dig out 3x3 areas?** Check out the special tools added by [Easy Emerald Tools & More](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-emerald-tools-fabric). To easily see all of the available items and their recipes in-game, type `@emerald` (or any other part of the mod name) into [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi)'s search bar in your inventory screen to filter the list to items added by the mod. Left-click on any item to see its recipe.
