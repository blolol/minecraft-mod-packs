**Perkpack is Blolol's Minecraft mod pack, used for blocky shenanigans on our Minecraft server.**

It doesn't follow any particular theme, and is a reflection of the community's whims. Sometimes we might be interested in a minimalist "vanilla plus" experience, then ruthlessly strip-mining every dimension to oblivion using advanced technology, and the next world might be a hardcore survival challenge.

The current release, Perkpack 2, is based on Minecraft 1.18 and revolves around the [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) and [MineColonies](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minecolonies) mods. Create adds mechanical components with which you can build all kinds of animated contraptions for automation or decoration‚Äîcheck out [its trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR8W-f9YhYA) to get an idea of what's possible. MineColonies expands on Minecraft's villages, allowing you to create thriving towns and cities with populations of NPCs who gather and use resources as you, the mayor, direct. For a complete list of included mods, see ["Mods"](#mods), below.

## Versions

Perkpack bumps its major version number for each significant Minecraft update (e.g. from Minecraft 1.18 to 1.19).

| Perkpack Version     | Minecraft Version |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Perkpack 2 (current) | Minecraft 1.18    |
| Perkpack 1           | Minecraft 1.17    |

As described in ["How to play"](#how-to-play), below, the mod pack automatically keeps itself up to date once you've installed it. However, if you're interested in the changes between versions, you can find release notes here: https://github.com/blolol/minecraft-mod-packs/releases

Mod pack updates are also announced by Wheaties in the `#minecraft` channels of [Blolol's IRC and Discord servers](https://blolol.com/chat).

## How to play

Playing Perkpack is a little more involved than launching the vanilla game, but it's nothing onerous. You'll only need to install the mod pack once per significant Minecraft update (e.g. from Minecraft 1.18 to 1.19). It will otherwise automatically keep itself up to date.

1. Install Java 17. [PolyMC has good cross-platform instructions](https://polymc.org/wiki/getting-started/installing-java/) on how to install Adoptium's open source Temurin 17 distribution.
1. Install the third-party, cross-platform [PolyMC](https://polymc.org) Minecraft game launcher. (PolyMC is a [community-oriented fork](https://polymc.org/wiki/overview/faq/) of [MultiMC](https://multimc.org), which should also work.)
1. Click the "Add Instance" button. The "New Instance" window will open. Give your instance a name, like "Perkpack". You can optionally set a group, which is a way to organize your Minecraft instances in the main PolyMC window. For example, you could group your instances by Minecraft game version.
1. In the "New Instance" window, select "Import from zip" in the left sidebar.
1. Copy and paste this URL into the text field: https://s3.amazonaws.com/minecraft/mod-packs/perkpack/perkpack-polymc-instance.zip<br>![Installing Perkpack in PolyMC on a Mac](images/readme/polymc-installation.png)
1. Click OK. PolyMC will create a new instance with the name you specified. Double click the ![Perkpack icon](images/perkpack-16.png) Perkpack icon to play! Every time you launch the game, Perkpack will automatically update itself.
1. In Minecraft's main menu, click "Multiplayer". Blolol's Minecraft server should already be added to your server list. If, for some reason, it isn't, connect to `mc.blolol.com`.

Since your Perkpack instance is a new installation of the game, it will use Minecraft's default settings. You may want to customize the game options to suit your preferences. In particular, check out:

* The key bindings (Options ‚Üí Controls ‚Üí Key Binds), because some mods add new controls that you may want to bind.
* Video settings (Options ‚Üí Video Settings), because the mod pack adds many performance optimizations and visual enhancements.
