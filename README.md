# Blolol Minecraft Mod Packs

A collection of mod packs used on Blolol's Minecraft servers.

## Creating a mod pack

Each subdirectory of `packs` contains a [packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz) mod pack definition. packwiz is a command line tool for creating Minecraft mod packs.

To create a new mod pack, create a new subdirectory of `packs`, change directory into it, and run `packwiz init` per [packwiz's getting started guide](https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/creating/getting-started/). packwiz will prompt you for several details, like the pack's name, maintainer, version, and desired Minecraft and mod loader versions.

### Adding and updating mods

To add mods to the pack, use [packwiz's install commands](https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/creating/adding-mods/). For example, to add [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) 0.5.0c to a pack:

```sh
packwiz curseforge install https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create/files/3872145
```

## Releasing a mod pack

To build and release a mod pack version, push a tag named like `perkpack/1.0.0` to GitHub, where `perkpack` matches the name of a mod pack in the `packs` directory (the pack's "slug"), and `1.0.0` is the mod pack version.

The GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/release.yml` will:

* Upload all pack files to the `minecraft` Amazon S3 bucket using the AWS CLI's `s3 sync` command. They will be publicly readable at `https://s3.amazonaws.com/minecraft/mod-packs/$PACK_SLUG`, e.g. https://s3.amazonaws.com/minecraft/mod-packs/perkpack/pack.toml.
* Draft a [release](https://github.com/blolol/minecraft-mod-packs/releases) on the GitHub repository, to which release notes should be added and published.

### Distributing a mod pack

You can [create a self-updating PolyMC instance](https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/installing/packwiz-installer/) using [packwiz-installer-bootstrap](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz-installer-bootstrap) and a URL like https://s3.amazonaws.com/minecraft/mod-packs/perkpack/pack.toml, where `perkpack` is the pack's slug.

The default release notes generated by GitHub Actions will include a link to `https://s3.amazonaws.com/minecraft/mod-packs/$PACK_SLUG/$PACK_SLUG-polymc-instance.zip`. It's up to you to manually upload that file, or edit the release notes.
